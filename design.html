<h5>Design Principles</h5>
	
<div class="article column9">
<h6>Visual hierarchy</h6>	
<p>Duckett (2011, p.467-468) explains the purpose of visual hierarchy because users do not read entire pages.</p>
<p>Contrast can be achieved by focusing on size, colour, style and images.<p>
<p>A good example to demonstrate effective contrast on a page is <a href="https://www.kaizenbrandevolution.com/">kaizenbrandevolution.</a></p>
</div>	

<div class="article column10">
<p class="quote">“Visual hierarchy refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed.” </p>
<p class="author">Jon Duckett</p>
</div>

<div class="article column11">
<p class="quote">“Repetition of a similar colour, size, orientation, texture, font, or shape, suggests that matching elements have similar importance or meaning.” </p>
<p class="author">Jon Duckett</p>
</div>


<div class="article column12">
<h6>Grouping and similarity</h6>	
<p>Duckett (2011, p.469-470) explains we naturally observe similarities in design.</p>
<p>The website <a href="https://www.kaizenbrandevolution.com/">kaizenbrandevolution</a>shows good examples of proximity and whitespace.  

<p><b>Proximity</b><br>The images used to promote their portfolio of work on the homepage are grouped together in close proximity. If you click on one image, the user will expect the other images that are grouped to react in the same way and link to the project in the portfolio of work.</p>

<p><b>White space</b><br>There is no white space used to separate the related portfolio of work images on the homepage but there are large amounts of white space between unrelated items to let the user know that other information isn’t related to the portfolio of work images. 
</div>		

<div class="article column13">
<h6>Design navigation</h6>
<p>Duckett (2011) explains that site navigation is a way to guide people through a website while giving them some understanding to what the website is about and offering them. This is done on <a href="https://www.kaizenbrandevolution.com/">kaizenbrandevolution</a> effectively by being concise and consistent.</p>

<p>The navigation bar is easy to read because the links are concise, and these are present on a white background. These links stay in the same place throughout each page of the website for good consistency. Secondary navigation like breadcrumbs aren’t available but the consistency of the links at the top are sufficient.</p>
